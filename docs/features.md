# SuperScroll Features & Improvements

## üöÄ Performance Improvements

### Smooth Scrolling
- **Before**: Used `setInterval` which caused laggy, jerky scrolling
- **After**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for buttery-smooth 60fps scrolling
- **Benefit**: Eliminates lag and provides a much more pleasant user experience

### Optimized Resource Usage
- Intelligent cleanup on page unload
- Proper animation frame cancellation
- Reduced CPU usage compared to interval-based approach

## üéõÔ∏è Enhanced Controls

### 3-Button Interface
- **Scroll Up**: Start scrolling upward
- **Scroll Down**: Start scrolling downward  
- **Pause**: Stop scrolling immediately

### 5 Speed Presets
1. **Very Slow**: 30 pixels/second - Perfect for careful reading
2. **Slow**: 60 pixels/second - Comfortable reading pace
3. **Moderate**: 120 pixels/second - Default balanced speed
4. **Fast**: 200 pixels/second - Quick browsing
5. **Very Fast**: 350 pixels/second - Rapid content scanning

## ‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard Shortcuts

| Shortcut | Action |
|----------|--------|
| `Alt + S` | Toggle scroll (start/stop) |
| `Alt + ‚Üë` | Start scrolling up |
| `Alt + ‚Üì` | Start scrolling down |
| `Alt + P` | Pause scrolling |

*Note: Shortcuts only work when not focused on input fields*

6. **Export/Import Settings**: Backup and restore user preferences

## üêõ Known Limitations

- Cannot scroll within iframes due to browser security restrictions
- Some websites with complex scroll hijacking may interfere with the extension
- Keyboard shortcuts may conflict with website-specific shortcuts

## üìû Support

If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please:
1. Check the keyboard shortcuts are working (Alt + S to test)
2. Try refreshing the page and reopening the extension
3. Test on a simple webpage to isolate the issue
4. Report bugs with specific website URLs where issues occur
